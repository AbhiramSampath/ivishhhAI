# TODO: Fix Expo Doctor Issues

- [x] Remove .expo directory from Git tracking using `git rm --cached -r .expo` (No .expo files were in the index)
- [x] Run `expo prebuild` to sync native configurations from app.json
- [x] Run `npx expo-doctor` to verify issues are resolved (Still failing)
- [ ] Test the app to ensure it works after changes
